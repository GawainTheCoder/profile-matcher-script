  - Extracted 16 skills, primary phrase: "Senior UX/UI Designer"

### ✅ Core Functionality Tests
- **Name Parsing**: `"Artur R." → first_name="Artur", last_initial="R"`
- **Feature Extraction**: Successfully extracted all profile components
- **Query Generation**: Produced targeted LinkedIn search queries
- **Candidate Scoring**: Mock scoring working with signals detection
- **URL Validation**: LinkedIn profile detection working

### ✅ Import Tests
All modules import correctly with proper fallback handling for missing dependencies.

## Code Quality Improvements

### **Before Modularization:**
- 📁 **1 file**: 1,833 lines
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Difficult to modify individual components
- 🧪 **Testing**: Hard to test individual functions
- 📚 **Readability**: Mixed concerns in single large file

### **After Modularization:**
- 📁 **8 modules**: Main script reduced to 459 lines (75% reduction!)
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility
- 🧪 **Testing**: Individual components easily testable
- 📚 **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns
- 🔄 **Reusability**: Components can be imported independently

## Production Readiness

The modular version is ready for production use. Users just need to:

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install requests python-dotenv`
2. **Set API keys**: Configure SERP provider API keys
3. **Run normally**: Same command-line interface as before
